# Welcome to our Living Systematic Review on COVID-19


On this website, we explain how we set up a *Living Systematic Review* that can:
* Collect evidence from different sources
* Deduplicates information according to different criteria
* Moves information to a central database
* Creates flexible output in RShiny [Like this](https://zika.ispm.unibe.ch/assets/data/pub/ncov/)
