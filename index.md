## Welcome to our Living Systematic Review on COVID-19


On this we explain how we set up a Living Systematic Review that can:
* collect evidence from different sources
* deduplicates information according to different criteria
* moves information to a central database
* creates flexible output in RShiny [Like this](https://zika.ispm.unibe.ch/assets/data/pub/ncov/)
