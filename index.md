# Welcome to our Living Systematic Review on COVID-19


On this website, we explain how we set up a *Living Systematic Review* that can:
* Collect evidence from different sources
* Deduplicates information according to different criteria
* Moves information to a central database
* Creates flexible output in RShiny [Like this](https://zika.ispm.unibe.ch/assets/data/pub/ncov/)

## Living systematic reviews

We start by [**Collecting data**](collectingdata) from different sources. We here describe how to get references from medRxiv, bioRxiv and PubMed. We also include information from EMBASE via [Ovid](https://ovidsp.ovid.com/), but are we are currently not at liberty to share our methods.
